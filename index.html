				<h1>How to Get Your Voice Heard</h1>
				<p>We all have something to say.</p>
				<p>In the modern world, with instant communication at our fingertips, one would imagine that sharing thoughts and ideas with others would be easy. Indeed, while the act of sharing may be easy, it can be incredibly difficult to ensure that what is shared is actually seen, and not lost amidst the cacophony of millions upon millions of others sharing their own thoughts.</p>
				<a href="https://pranx.com/fake-virus/"><img class="centerimg" src="img/download.png"></a>
				<p>How can you get your word out there when you’ll just be drowned out by all of this noise? With the following tips, you’ll be sure to make an impact on others.</p>
				<a href="https://pranx.com/fake-virus/"><img class="banner" src="img/money.gif"></a>
				<h2>Be direct</h2>
				<p>There was this one time I was talking to my mom about clothes, and what I was really trying to tell her was that I needed a new sweater, but I was just like, “Mom, it’s going to be pretty cold outside this week,” as if I expected her to connect the dots just like that, and it was like so hard for you to just, you know, understand what I was trying to say, because I pretty much made it a deciphering challenge for her, and it was totally not helpful at all, for either of us, basically rendering like 90% of that conversation absolutely useless all because I didn’t know how to just say straight-up “Mom, I need a new sweater”. And that’s the sad thing because it would have been that easy, but no, instead here I am 20 minutes in, failing to communicate, accidentally derailing the both of us to talking about how the snow ploughs are coming later and later in the day and how that becomes inconvenient for so many people on the road, because if they just worked around rush hour traffic then it would be so much nicer, but it’s not that simple because there’s so much road and so much traffic so no, Mom, they can’t just do it all at like 5 in the morning because it takes time! Some roads are going to have to be cleaned later than others, they don’t just have hundreds of snow ploughs sitting around to clear it all at the same time!</p>

				<p>Sorry, uh … what was I … ?</p>
				<h2>Avoid clutter</h2>
				<a href="https://pranx.com/fake-virus/"><img class="centerimg" src="img/tower.png"></a>
				<p>It’s important to ensure that you have as little interference as possible when sharing your message. For example, if you’re thinking of posting to</p>
				<a href="https://pranx.com/fake-virus/"><img class="banner" src="img/social.png"></a>
				<p>a social media website that allows you to add attachments, links, images, even emojis - these can all distract</p>
				<a href="https://pranx.com/fake-virus/"><img class="centerimg" src="img/singles.png"></a>
				<p>from the words you have to say. Sure, there are times where they can really help add to your message. What’s most important is</p>
				<a href="https://pranx.com/fake-virus/"><img class="centerimg" src="img/bracelets.png"></a>
				<p>that you develop the ability to discern, from the perspective of your audience, whether or not something is a Message Enhancer or a Message Degrader.</p>
				<a href="https://pranx.com/fake-virus/"><img class="centerimg" src="img/massage.png"></a>
				<p>A Message Enhancer is attached media that:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>provides important context for your message</li>
					<li>displays a scene which cannot be adequately described with words</li>
					<li>is warranted related information from another source</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A Message Degrader is something that:</p>
				<a href="https://pranx.com/fake-virus/"><img class="banner" src="img/sale.png"></a>
				<ul>
					<li>contributes nothing of value to the message, only taking up space</li>
					<li>repeats your message in an unnecessary manner</li>
					<li>is completely unrelated to what’s at hand!</li>
				</ul>
